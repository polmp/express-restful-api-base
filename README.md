# Express Restful API Base
This repository contains a base for starting the backend of a webpage using the Rest principles.

## Quick start
Simply clone this project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/polmp/express-restful-api-base.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Set the NODE_ENV variable to production (if you want to use the development mode, simply skip this step):

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=prodction
```

If you use the development mode (default) you may need to install nodemon globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

Start your app at `http://localhost:3000/` for development (Nodemon):

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

or the production mode:

```bash
$ npm start
```
